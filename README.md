# 📊 Population Data Visualization

This project visualizes the **distribution of categorical and continuous variables**, such as **age** and **gender**, from a population dataset using Python.

## 🔍 Objective

To perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and generate visualizations (bar chart / histogram) to better understand the distribution of:

- Age (continuous variable)
- Gender (categorical variable)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (optional)

## 📁 Dataset

You can use any dataset with `age` and `gender` columns. For demonstration, this project assumes a CSV file with the following structure:

```csv
Name,Age,Gender
John,28,Male
Jane,34,Female
